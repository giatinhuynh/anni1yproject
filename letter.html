                <p>I bet it’s 11:00 PM when you read this, it’s our official 1 year anniversary bbi!! As you read this, I hope the flowers and letter delivered to your doorstep have brought a smile to your face. Bet you didn’t expect I’d send you another gift hahaha, surprise! Here's another bloom for you in our virtual rose garden, I’m a mastermind, and you’re mine. My bbi deserves to be blanketed in flowers. 💐🌸🌼🌹🌷</p>
            
                <p>This will be our online rose garden, where I will add a rose each passing year that we are together. These roses won't lose their beauty and will always be here as a reminder of our journey. I hope you like it, I know it's not as beautiful as the real ones, but I made them with all my love. Looking forward to a garden full of roses :000. Again, happy 1 year anniversary, babi! I’m so happy right now, looking back at our journey and knowing that you’re mine and we’ve been together for 1 year!!!! Thank you so much for everything, for being my smoothie butter cookie dookie pookie cutie babi, for being my sweet darling, and for being the very best friend to me. 🥺</p>
            
                <p>Dear Daisy, as the sun rises and the moon sets, no matter what happens and no matter how time flows, I will always ask you to go out with me. You are my favorite canon event, and I won’t stop telling you about how much I love and adore you because you are very very very special to me 🥹🥹🥹</p>
            
                <p>Dear Daisy, no matter where I am, no matter the distance between us, I will always save a seat for you wherever I go. I will say this again, distance means nothing when you are everything. I'll try my best to be with you, to take care of you, and to make you the happiest babi ever. I'll handle everything and so don't worri bbi 💪💪💪</p>
